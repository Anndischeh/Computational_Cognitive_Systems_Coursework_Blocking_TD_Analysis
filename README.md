# Computational Cognitive Systems Coursework: Phenomena Analysis

This repository contains the final report for the **Computational Cognitive Systems** coursework. Two cognitive phenomena were analyzed using simulation software: **Blocking** and **Serial Order Discrimination**.

## Phenomena and Analysis

### 1. Blocking
The Blocking phenomenon was simulated using the **Rescorla-Wagner v5 simulator**.  
Comparisons were made between the **Rescorla-Wagner** and **Mackintosh** models in the context of blocking.

### 2. Serial Order Discrimination
The Serial Order Discrimination phenomenon was simulated using the **SSCC-TD simulator**.  
A comparison was conducted between **SSCC-TD** and **TD models**, highlighting key differences.

## Files
- `Report.pdf` â€“ The final coursework report summarizing methods, simulations, and results.  
- Simulation code and data used for the analyses.

## Summary
This repository showcases the application of computational modeling techniques to understand cognitive phenomena, highlighting differences between established models and simulation approaches.
